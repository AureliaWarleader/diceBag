Yet another simple dice rolling library using standard dice notation

--Note: I referenced other people's work fairly heavily. This was a learning experience for me so the project was largely looking at other
code, trying to break it down and understand it, and taking what I learned and using it to write my own. As such, it's exceptionally similar
to the code referenced. It should also be noted that the regex used in this code is directly copied. I have next to no knowledge of how
regex works at this point so I decided to use what was available for the time being.
The code I primarily referenced came from a gist written by thebinarypenguin(https://gist.github.com/thebinarypenguin). The gist can be found
here (https://gist.github.com/thebinarypenguin/5811014) and they have another dice rolling project called droll that can be found here 
(https://github.com/thebinarypenguin/droll).
